# Design Patterns in Modern CPP

Based on [Dmitri Nesteruk's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/patterns-cplusplus)

## SOLID Principles
### S - Single Responsibility
A Class should have a single reason to change
It should have a primary responsibility and not take on other responsibilities
### O - Open Closed
Systems should be open to extension, but closed to modification
